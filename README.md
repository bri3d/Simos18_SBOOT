# About

This project provides documentation about the Supplier Bootloader (SBOOT) provided in Simos18 ECUs, with a focus on the OTP/Customer Protection module supplied by VW AG in VW vehicles.

For more background about Simos18 in general and the later-stage (Customer Bootloader/CBOOT) exploit used for unsigned code execution, please see [my other documentation](https://github.com/bri3d/VW_Flash/blob/master/docs.md).

The SBOOT is the first part of the ECU's trust chain after the CPU mask ROM. It starts at 0x80000000 (the beginning of Program Memory) and has a few basic responsibilities:

* Early-stage startup of the Tricore CPU's peripherals and clock initialization and re-sync.
* Validation of the "Validity flags" for CBOOT, the next bootloader stage.
* Promotion of a customer-supplied CBOOT update (CBOOT_temp) into the CBOOT area, after validating the "validity flags" and CRC checksum.
* Access to a supplier "recovery" backdoor. This takes the form of an ISO-TP over CAN "command shell" which is accessed if CBOOT is invalid or a specific timing of rising edges is met on two PWM pins. This "emergency recovery" mechanism seems to be loosely shared across many modern ECUs, although the signal specifics and CAN commands seem to differ between different hardware. In Simos18, this command shell is accessed using two square-edge signals running at the same frequency but with a specific phase shift. This command shell allows the upload of an RSA-signed bootstrap loader which is executed with Flash unlocked for Write access (unlike the native Tricore BSL, which is unsigned but cannot access Flash at all). The signature-checking functionality is provided by the customer-supplied One Time Programming area starting at 80014000, and the RSA signature is validated against a public key with identifier `0x136` which is the third public key in the OTP area.

Startup pretty much happens in this order, as well. First, SBOOT sets up a large number of peripheral registers using initliazation data hardcoded in Flash. Next, SBOOT initalizes the main clocks, importantly, setting the PLL base frequency for timers to 8.75Mhz.

# Happy Path

If a "Recovery" break-in doesn't occur at this stage, first a check is made against Flash at 80840500 to see if a "CBOOT_temp" awaits promotion. If it does, the CRC is validated and the CBOOT_temp is copied into the "normal" CBOOT area. SBOOT responds with some hardcoded Wait responses on CAN to keep the tester alive, and then the new CBOOT is loaded.

If no "CBOOT_temp" awaits promotion, the Valid flags (H$B) of the "main" CBOOT are checked (notably, not its CRC), a strange set of commands is sent to the Flash controller, and then CBOOT is executed.

If no Valid flags are set for "main" CBOOT, the recovery shell is entered.

# Recovery Shell Entry Details (GPT/PWM/"PW")

SBOOT sets up CAN message handlers, using the standard UDS channel IDs 0x7E0 and 0x7E8, and then sets up the "GPTA" comparator peripheral on the Tricore to measure two signals for "break-in." The two signals are measured as follows:

Signal 1 triggers a reset of a GPTA timer at each rising edge.
Signal 2 triggers an interrupt at each rising edge.

When the Signal 2 interrupt is triggered, two measurements are made:
* The GPTA timer counter value. This measures the distance between posedge(Sig1) and posedge(Sig2).
* The CPU central timer counter difference between the last triggered interrupts. This measures the distance between posedge(Sig2) and posedge(Sig2).

These two measurements are checked to be < 0x80A and < 0xAAA, respectively. Given the 8.75Mhz GPT and STM clocks, this yields 235.2uS for the Sig1->Sig2 measurement and 312uS for the Sig2->Sig2 measurement, setting the base frequency to 3.2kHz and the phase shift to roughly 1/4.

Please see the included Python script for a way to set these two frequencies up using pigpiod's WavePWM on the Raspberry Pi. Note that the outputs from the Pi need to be level shifted up to 5V to be registered by the Tricore in Simos18.

If the PWM signals match, two CAN messages are checked. 

First, a message `59 45` (`80002b70`). If this message is present, `0xA0` is returned. Next, a message `6B` is expected (`80004a48`), to which `0xA0` is again returned. If these conditions are met, SBOOT will jump into the "recovery shell" awaiting setup of a bootstrap loader.

# Recovery Shell Tasks

The recovery shell now runs four tasks.

* The first task is an ISO-TP command REPL based on a state machine, documented below.
* The second task appears to be part of the ISO-TP message pump logic for that command REPL. It also handles soft rebooting the ECU with reason code `0x200` if the REPL's state machine is set to 10dec (0xA), which occurs if a specific password is sent to the "7D" command. I am not yet sure if `0x200` as the restart reason is handled in a special way.
* The third task runs from RAM at d001fd80 . It services the Tricore Watchdog Timer and bit-bangs a fixed message out to the Port3 GPIO. It's not yet certain what the purpose of the bit-bang is - perhaps it is servicing an external watchdog peripheral, or is for debugging. More investigation is required. This is definitely a side-channel through which information can be exfiltrated (as the watchdog is serviced outside of the usual timer schedule before certain flash tasks), but probably isn't the source of an existing exploit. This also increments a timer value which is used in the main REPL to require a delay before requesting Seed/Key authentication. 
* The fourth task just counts up.

The recovery shell now sets up ISO-TP framing and expects the following messages:

```
TESTER -> EXPECTED REPLY

7D 41 43 57 -> A0, sets the "current state" to 0xA which seems to exit the command shell.
7D 4E 42 30 ("NB0") -> A0, just a part number check? Doesn't seem to alter any other state.

6B -> A0 02. This is the SBOOT version of TesterPresent, works regardless of state.
30 ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? (???) -> A0 . This one is weird. It checks that int 3 is equal to a value at 8000081C, but there's nothing there... It then sets two words at D0000010 to the first two words of the payload. All 0s seems to work. This command is required to esclate the state from 0 to 2 to enable the 54 command to be accessed.
54 -> A0 XX XX XX XX 00 01 36 followed by 0x100 bytes of Seed material. This configures the Public Key with ID "0x0136", then uses a Mersenne Twister seeded with the system timer to generate 256 random bytes, encrypts the generated data using the RSA Public Key 0x136, and sends the encrypted data to the tester.
65 ??x100 -> A0 Key Response. The ECU expects the tester to be able to decrypt the random Seed data which was encrypted using the public key and send it back. This, of course, requires the corresponding private key, unless the value can be guessed or generated another way (which it can!). 
78 AA AA AA AA XX ... -> Set Address -> Value. Value is a varargs length based on the framing length from CAN. AA AA AA AA is a bounds-checked offset, which will be translated to an address between B0010000 and B0015000. This command be used any number of times to set up the BSL in RAM.
```

The BSL structure which is set up using the `78` command looks like so:   

```
B0010000 -> CRC Seed / Start Value
B0010004 -> Expected CRC Value
B0010008 -> CRC Range Count - Checked against 1
B001000C -> CRC Start Address - Bounds checked to be <= 0xb0010131
B0010010 -> CRC End Address - Bounds checked to be >= 0xb001012f
B0010130 -> BSL entry address pointer - loaded after signature check, and execution jumps there. 
```
One final command is available:

`79 -> Validate and execute BSL.` This first copies the CRC header into a RAM structure for CRC validation. Next, it iterates through the CRC checksum, 0x100 bytes at a time, and then checks it against the stored value. Finally, it calls the "validate signature" function in the OTP cryptography library, which generates the SHA256 of the bootloader, checks it against the sum embedded in the RSA signature, and if everything matches, Flash is unlocked and then the entry point is executed in RAM.

# Exploit Methodology

This exploit revolves around a simple mistake: the Mersenne Twister PRNG used to generate the random Key data is seeded using the value of the System Timer (STM0) register.

So, we know that the Mersenne Twister seed number is deterministic, since no entropy is correctly introduced: it is seeded off of the system timer only, which is not an entropy source since with the same inputs, the CPU should produce the same outputs. Furthermore the seed is passed through `| 1` (odds only), so it is an even more poor source of entropy - the keyspace is only 2^31, and the realistic keyspace is very small due to the use of a deterministic source in the form of the timer.

Since CAN messages are also buffered and processed in a loop pumped using the same timer, with some plausibly tight timing it is possible to "hit" a very close range of Mersenne Twister seed numbers. And, because the random data which is encrypted and passed back is not dynamically salted at all, it is possible to pass back the desired data by performing the generation algorithm again outside of the ECU, which gives us access to both the random data (Key) and encrypted random data (Seed). By brute-forcing until we find Key data which produces a matching Seed, we can pass the seed/key algorithm with [this tool](twister.c) .

So far, my testing indicates that even with a Raspberry Pi as the tester, having very poor timing constraints, the system timer value can be reproduced to within a few hundred thousand cycles by sending CAN messages in the same order. This reduces the size of the Seed/Key space to a size which can be easily brute-forced on modern hardware. On my M1 MacBook Air, I can enumerate roughly 100,000 pairs per second on a single core. There is a trivial protection against this attack in that the bootloader requires 100 iterations of the watchdog service routine to have executed before it will allow the Seed to be generated, but again, this is deterministic and doesn't actually represent a protection (it just makes an attack slightly harder).

Next, we can use the poor bounds-checking on the CRC header to begin a checksum process against the boot passwords as stored in Flash. By then quickly resetting the CPU into BSL, before the process has a chance to run multiple iterations, we are able to inspect the state of the checksum routine. And by sliding the start of the CRC, it is possible to determine the influence of each set of bytes on the CRC and to back-calculate the bytes in question, revealing the boot passwords.

# Exploit Step-By-Step

The exploit process has been proven out, but not yet automated. So far, the process works like this:

Set up ECU for Bootstrap Loader using https://github.com/bri3d/TC1791_CAN_BSL as a guide. Unfortunately, you will need to open the ECU and probe or solder to several very small vias. This is necessary to allow the use of the CPU RST pin, as well as the upload of a low-level Tricore Bootstrap Loader to read the CRC data out of RAM and access Flash once passwords are recovered.

Use "bootloader.py" from that same repository to perform the following steps:

```
(BSL) upload
(...)
Device jumping into BSL... Draining receive queue...
```
The SBOOT entry process is much more reliable when starting from the Bootstrap Loader rather than running ASW. I believe this is due to CAN buffering in Linux getting in the way of the entry messages.

```
There's the Seed data, produced by encrypting unknown Key data generated using the Mersenne Twister PRNG. Now we need to recover the Key data by brute-forcing Seed values until we find a match. The timing is controlled enough that the timer value should be somewhere around 01D00000, which will allow the next step to work pretty quickly:

 ```
Here, we use `twister` from this repo to generate the Seed/Key data. The two parameters are 01D00000, the initial timer value to iterate up from, and BE284541, the first 32 bits of the Seed from the above commands. If your tester has different timings (I used a Raspberry Pi 3B+), you may need to increase or decrease the 01D00000 value to find a match in a reasonable amount of time. The faster the machine you can run `twister` on, the better - although it's unfortunately single threaded for the moment.

Now, we go back to the `bootstrap.py` script, and send back the Key data we calculated:

```
(BSL) sboot_sendkey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
Sending 0x65
a0
```
We're in! The `a0` success response means we passed Seed/Key and we can start sending data to the ECU.

Next up, we'll calculate the CRC for just 0x100 bytes of data anywhere in Flash, by sending a CRC header with the lower bound set to the location we wish to checksum, then quickly resetting the CPU after just one iteration of the CRC loop:

```
Here, we upload a small fake code block to the SBOOT command shell, consisting of a CRC header telling the shell to begin CRC checking at a specified address, 0x8001420C, and some fixed part number data necessary to pass a validator.

Next, we read back the CRC and end address (to make sure only a single iteration of the CRC algorithm was allowed to progress). Now we have the CRC value for 0x8001421C-0x8001431C! An astute reader will note that this range is actually after the boot passwords, and contains some crypto data from OTP (the Mersenne Twister seed and the beginning of the AES K-values, I think) - this lets us verify that our system is working, since we can checksum the known data and compare the result.

We copy the known data from this address in an SBOOT ROM dump, and calculate its checksum - it's a match, so we know the mechanism works!

```
crchack % ./crchack -x 00000000 -i 00000000 -w 32 -p 0x4c11db7 ../Simos-Crypto/21C.bin
4e5cecf4
```

Now, to actually recover passwords, we need to repeat this process, sliding the checksum value backwards 4 bytes at a time. Each time we slide the checksum value backwards, we can use https://github.com/resilar/crchack to generate the necessary data to match the checksum. By performing this process iteratively 4 bytes at a time, sliding back towards the boot passwords at 0x8001420C, we can infer their value.

```
crchack % ./crchack -x 00000000 -i 00000000 -w 32 -p 0x4c11db7 -b :4 ../Simos-Crypto/218.bin 0x4F2527F4 > 218.WRITE_PASSWORD_2.bin
```

The data at 80014200-8001420C is also known - it's the unique ID of the MCU, which is available as the output of the "deviceid" command in this BSL shell. So, I believe you could also complete this attack by sliding the CRC region forward rather than backwards using that known data rather than the data out of an SBOOT ROM dump.
